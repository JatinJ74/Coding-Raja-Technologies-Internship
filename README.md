# Coding Raja Technologies Internship

Welcome to the Coding Raja Technologies Internship repository!

I enrolled in a 2-month online internship program with Coding Raja Technologies, which focused on project-based learning. During the internship, I worked on two projects: a Movie Recommendation System and Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions. This repository contains the project files for both projects.

## Projects

### 1. Movie Recommendation System

The Movie Recommendation System is a Python-based application that provides personalized movie recommendations to users. It uses content-based filtering to recommend movies based on their similarity to user-input movies. The system also includes an autocomplete feature to suggest movie titles as users type.

### 2. Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

The Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions project focuses on identifying fraudulent activities in financial transactions. It employs machine learning algorithms to analyze transaction data and detect anomalies indicative of fraudulent behavior.
